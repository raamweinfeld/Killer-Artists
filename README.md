# How to Upload Assets (or anything) to the Project (The Quick and Easy Way)
  * First, you're gonna need to make sure you've installed Git (you could also use Atom, but Git coincides with the HARDCORE WAY of making changes): https://git-scm.com/downloads
## You downloaded it? No issues? Great. Now follow these steps:
  1. Now, you could clone the repository from the command line, but just download the ZIP - it's easier.
  2. Open up the Git GUI app that should've came with the Git installation.
  3. Select the ```Open Exisiting Repository``` option and browse for the unzipped repository folder.
  4. Drag and drop (or remove) whatever files you want into the project directory (artstuff goes into the ```assets``` folder) and then click the ```Rescan``` button on the GUI app to detect said changes.
  5. You'll want to "stage" any changes that you want to commit, so you can either select a single change and then press either ```Ctrl-T``` or go to ```Commit -> Stage To Commit```. You can also unstage changes by either pressing ```Ctrl-U``` while they're selected or ```Commit -> Unstage From Commit```.
  6. Once you're pleased with your staged changes, type a commit message in the textbox describing the changes in the commit, then click on the ```Push``` button and viola! You've pushed a commit to the repository.
